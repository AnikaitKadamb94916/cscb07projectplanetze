Documentation format is flexible but should contain:

  - instructions on how to use the code,
  - a guide for developers on maintaining and developing the code in the future,
  - describing the overall structure,
  - description of key components,
  - list dependencies and explain why it's needed,
  - all the assumptions your group made about everything,
  - links to your GitHub, Jira,
  - existing credentials to sign in to your app,
  - and anything else you think would be appropriate and relevant to include.
